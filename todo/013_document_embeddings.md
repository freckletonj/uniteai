# 013 Document Embeddings

- TODO
  - cache embeddings with model name to allow user to experiment with different embedding models easily.
  - use spacy instead of sliding window to do embeddings. This will necessitate changes to caching.
  - option to recursively search a directory and find relevant docs, then relevant sections.

- Support
  - [X] Github Repos
  - [X] PDFs
  - [X] Individual docs
  - [X] Local harddrive files
