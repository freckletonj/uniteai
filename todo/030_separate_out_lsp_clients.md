# 030 Separate out LSP Clients from the Server's Repo

Someone on the Discord pointed out to me that this is a Best Practice, and I think I agree.

Not to mention, AFAICT editors like VSCode make it hard to adjust key combos if you're installing from their marketplace, so, having a separate, well cared for package that people can modify and install themselves might be beneficial.
